# freesound-juce

A JUCE client for accessing the [Freesound](https://freesound.org) API. From the Freesound API docs:

> With the Freesound API you can browse, search, and retrieve information about Freesound users, packs, and the sounds themselves of course. You can find similar sounds to a given target (based on content analysis) and retrieve automatically extracted features from audio files, as well as perform advanced queries combining content analysis features and other metadata (tags, etcâ€¦). With the Freesound API, you can also upload, comment, rate and bookmark sounds!

The freesound-juce client automatically maps function arguments to HTTP parameters of the Freesound API. JSON results are parsed and converted to C++ objects. The main object classes (`SoundList`, `Sound`,
`User`, `Pack`) implement utility methods to further interact with the API.

The freesound-juce client includes a simple example command line application built with JUCE v5.4.4 which shows how to use it. Client's [documentation can be found here](https://mtg.github.io/freesound-juce/index.html). However we recommend you to check the [official Freesound API documentation]((https://freesound.org/docs/api/)) to get more information about the available API endpoints and features.


## Usage

To use freesound-juce just copy `FreesoundAPI.h` and `FreesoundAPI.cpp` to your project source folder and `#include "FreesoundAPI.h"`.

To access the API you'll need to create a Freesound user account and apply for an API key at [https://freesound.org/api/apply/](https://freesound.org/api/apply/). Then, an `FreesoundClient`
needs to be instantiated with the api key as a parameter. Note that this client can do both token-based
authentication or OAuth2 and there are specific functions for them.


## Quick example

```cpp
FreesoundClient client(secret);
SoundList list = client.textSearch("bass");
Array<FSSound> arrayOfSearch = list.toArrayOfSounds();
for (int i = 0; i < arrayOfSearch.size(); i++) {
  name = arrayOfSearch[i].name;
  username = arrayOfSearch[i].user;
  std::cout << "Sound Name: " << name << " Username: " << username << std::endl;
}

```


## Example applications

Check out this cool example apps:

 * [Demo app](https://github.com/aframires/freesound-juce/blob/master/Source/Main.cpp): simple command-line utility that makes some queries to Freesound to demonstrate how the client works. Includes OAuth2 authentication example as well.
 * [FreesoundUploader](https://github.com/aframires/FreesoundUploader): let's you upload sounds to Freesound directly from your DAW!
